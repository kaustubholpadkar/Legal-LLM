It requires to consumer to exercise the imagination in order to draw a conclusion as to the nature of the goods and services.\n - **Arbitrary**: Arbitrary terms are those that are real words, but arbitrary with respect to the product.\n - **Fanciful**: Fanciful terms are those that are entirely made up, and not found in the English dictionary."

        "description": "Large datasets of court opinions are typically limited to identifying and coding technical information, such as the names of the parties and the judge(s), and sometimes the outcome and the legal topics of the case. However, the most important part of any judicial opinion, the legal reasoning, is typically treated as a black box in empirical legal scholarship. This task begins to address this shortcoming. It focuses on the way that judges provide legal reasoning for the finding of causality (specifically, in labor discrimination cases), and labels the text based on the question of whether the judge/s, in their written reasoning, relied on statistical evidence (e.g., regression analysis) or direct evidence (e.g., witnesses' testimonies) when determining the legal question of whether there was a causal link between the plaintiff's characteristics (e.g., gender, race) and the contested decision (to hire them, set a certain wage, etc.)."

        "description": "When one company sells its assets to another company, the purchaser is generally not liable for the seller\u2019s debts and liabilities. Successor liability is a common law exception to this general rule. In order to spot a successor liability issue, lawyers must understand how courts apply the doctrine.\n The doctrine holds purchasers of all, or substantially all, of a seller\u2019s assets liable for the debts and liabilities of the seller if:\n 1. the purchaser expressly agrees to be held liable;\n 2. the assets are fraudulently conveyed to the purchaser in order to avoid liability;\n 3. there is a de facto merger between the purchaser and seller; or\n 4. the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller.\n Express agreement is governed by standard contract law rules. In practice, if a purchase agreement contains a provision to assume liabilities, litigation will rarely arise. Courts, however, sometimes interpret express agreement in the absence of a written provision. \n Assets are fraudulently conveyed when the seller intends to escape liability through an asset sale or knows that liability will be avoided through an asset sale.\n De facto merger is a multifactor test that consists of (1) continuity of ownership; (2) cessation of ordinary business and dissolution of the acquired corporation as soon as possible; (3) assumption by the purchaser of the liabilities ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of the business of the acquired corporation; and (4) continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operation. Some jurisdictions require a showing of all four elements. Others do not and simply emphasize that the substance of the asset sale is one of a merger, regardless of its form.\n Mere continuation requires a showing that after the asset sale, only one corporation remains and there is an overlap of stock, stockholders, and directors between the two corporations. There are two variations of the mere continuation exception. The first is the \u201ccontinuity of enterprise\u201d exception. In order to find continuity of enterprise, and thus liability for the purchaser of assets, courts engage in a multifactor analysis. Factors include: (1) retention of the same employees; (2) retention of the same supervisory personnel; (3) retention of the same production facilities in the same physical location; (4) production of the same product; (5) retention of the same name; (6) continuity of assets; (7) continuity of general business operations; and (8) whether the successor holds itself out as the continuation of the previous enterprise. The second is the product line exception. This exception imposes liability on asset purchasers who continue manufacturing products of a seller\u2019s product line. This exception generally requires that defendants show that the purchaser of assets is able to assume the risk-spreading role of the original manufacturer, and that imposing liability is fair because the purchaser enjoys the continued goodwill of the original manufacturer."

A court (sitting in a particular forum) has personal jurisdiction over a defendant only when that defendant has a relationship with the forum. We focus on a simplified version of the rule for federal personal jurisdiction, using the rule:\n ```text\n There is personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the state where the defendant is domiciled, or when (1) the defendant has sufficient contacts with the state, such that they have availed themselves of the privileges of the state and (2) the claim arises out of the nexus of the defendant's contacts with the state.\n ```\n Under this rule, there are two paths for a court have jurisdiction over a defendant: through domicile or through contacts.\n - **Domicile**: A defendant is domiciled in a state if they are a citizen of the state (i.e. they live in the state). Changing residency affects a change in citizenship.\n - **Contacts**:  Alternatively, a court may exercise jurisdiction over a defendant when that defendant has *sufficient contacts* with the court's forum, and the legal claims asserted arise from the \\textit{nexus} of the defendant's contacts with the state. In evaluating whether a set of contacts are sufficient, lawyers look at the extent to which the defendant interacted with the forum, and availed themselves of the benefits and privileges of the state's laws. Behavior which usually indicates sufficient contacts include: marketing in the forum or selling/shipping products into the forum. In assessing nexus, lawyers ask if the claims brought against the defendant arise from their contacts with the forum. In short: is the conduct being litigated involve the forum or its citizens in some capacity?"
