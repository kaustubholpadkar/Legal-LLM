My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all. Like get some sort of financial compensation, and move far away.",

Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.  Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?",

I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about \"taking someone out.\" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???",

She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.  I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).  Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail?

I was a stay at home mom to his special needs child from another marriage for about 4 of thous years. Very unexpectedly 4 days ago he decided that when he returned from deployment we would no longer be together. Since then I made a post on /r/personal finance discussing my financial status and asking for advice on how to get on my own two feet again. Many responses urged me to seek legal advice and try to get my ex boyfriend to pay me more than what he is offering me. **I do not wish to take him to court. I am happy with what he is offering.** However, due to the nature of him being deployed and me still living in his home until he returns I am seeking advice on how to cover my ass legally so to speak.   **Details:**    - Location: Virginia Beach, VA    - He and his ex wife and her new husband are all active duty Navy     - He bought the home himself I am not legally tied to it in any way    - The only account of his that my name is on is our cell phone bill, and I have a solid plan on how to exit that smoothly    - He has offered to let me stay in the house until he returns from deployment in September    - Neither one of us are petty, spiteful, nor hateful people- but shit happens and we are trying to deal with it maturely     - There has been no talk of taking legal action and I don't think there will be but I'd rather be protected rather than naive     - Due to a job offer I may be out of the house sooner than he would like (by about 4-6 weeks depending on his return date) and will find proper temporary housing for our.. well now his dog.      - If at all possible I would like to never have to see him face to face again.    **My Current Plan**    - Make an itemized list of what I am taking from the house    - Have a witness present when I remove items from the house    - Have witness do a walk through of the condition of the house     - record walk through on video and send it to him before he returns    - ask his ex wife to take the dog temporarily until he returns    - discuss prior to me leaving landscaping plans with my ex       - I will surrender the keys to his ex wife with his written permission. **My Questions**    - Will the ex wife be a reliable choice as a witness or do I require someone less bias (she loves me and has a healthy amount of hate for him)? Or should I ask the next door neighbor? (we're not close and sharing something so personal with him seems very odd but he is someone we both would trust to stay impartial)    - speaking of written proof, do emails and facebook messages count?    -  is there anything else I should be thinking of to make sure I am protected in this situation?    **THANK YOU** Thank you so much for your advice, help, and support in advance.",

Our corporate office is located in California and a significant number of our restaurants are located in California, Texas and Florida which makes us particularly sensitive to economic, regulatory, weather and other risk factors and conditions that are more prevalent in those states.  Any negative publicity about us, our restaurants, other restaurants, or others across the food supply chain, due to food borne illness or other reasons, whether or not accurate may adversely affect the reputation and popularity of our restaurants and our results of operations.  Any adverse changes in the supply of food, labor, brewing, energy and other expenses, including those resulting from climate change, may adversely affect our operating results.  Periodic reviews and audits of our internal brewing, independent third party brewing and beer distribution arrangements by various federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies may adversely affect our operations and our operating results.  Government laws and regulations affecting the operation of our restaurants, including but not limited to those that apply to the acquisition and maintenance of our brewing and retail liquor licenses, minimum wages, federal or state exemption rules, health insurance coverage, or other employment benefits such as paid time off, consumer health and safety, nutritional disclosures, and employment eligibility-related documentation requirements may cause disruptions to our operations, adversely affect our operating costs and restrict our growth.  The first BJ's restaurant, which opened in 1978 in Orange County, California, was a small sit down pizzeria that featured Chicago style deep-dish pizza with a unique California twist. Our goal then and still today, is to be the best casual dining concept ever by focusing on high quality menu options, at a compelling value, a dining experience that exceeds customers' expectations for service, hospitality and enjoyment, and an atmosphere that is always welcoming and approachable.  In 1996, we introduced our initial proprietary craft beers and expanded the BJ's concept from its beginnings as a small pizzeria to a full-service, high energy casual dining restaurant when we opened our first large format restaurant featuring a brewing operations in Brea, California. Today our restaurants feature over 140 menu offerings including: slow roasted entrees, such as, prime rib; EnLIGHTened Entrees\u00ae such as our Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon; our original signature deep-dish pizza; the often imitated, but never replicated world-famous Pizookie\u00ae dessert; and our award-winning BJ's proprietary craft beers. As of February 25, 2019, we own and operate 202 restaurants located in 27 states, and our proprietary craft beer is produced at several of our locations, our Temple, Texas brewpub locations and by independent third party brewers using our proprietary recipes.  We compete in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, which is a large, highly fragmented segment with estimated annual sales in the $100+ billion range. We believe that the BJ's restaurant concept offers consumers a higher quality, more contemporary and approachable \"casual plus,\" \"premium casual,\" or \"polished casual\" dining experience than the more mature, mass market casual dining concepts. Our Gold Standard of Operational Excellence is our genuine commitment to take pride in passionately connecting with every customer on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail, during every shift \u2013 to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ' Our Gold Standard of Operational Excellence is focused on the following key areas that help to differentiate BJ's from other casual dining restaurants:  Over the years we have expanded the BJ's concept to include menu options that meet our customers ' preferences for any dining occasion.",

Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in, due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.  We believe that we have significant market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers, with approximately 71 % of our 201 8 same-store revenues generated in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (each, an \"MSA\", as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) with the highest population levels.

Our research focuses on key natural regulators of cellular growth and repair, particularly the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-beta, protein superfamily. By combining our discovery and development expertise, including our proprietary knowledge of the TGF-beta superfamily, and our internal protein engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we have generated several innovative therapeutic candidates, all of which encompass novel potential first-in-class mechanisms of action. We have focused and prioritized our research and development activities within three key therapeutic areas: hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary. If successful, these candidates could have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients across these areas of high, unmet need.  Luspatercept, our lead program, and sotatercept, are partnered with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. Luspatercept is an erythroid maturation agent designed to promote red blood cell production through a novel mechanism, and is being developed to treat chronic anemia and associated complications in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis. Celgene is currently conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept; one for the treatment of patients with lower-risk MDS, known as the \"MEDALIST\" trial, and another for the treatment of patients with beta-thalassemia, also known as the \"BELIEVE\" trial. Celgene has recently initiated a Phase 2 trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the \"BEYOND\" trial. We further expect Celgene to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial, the \"COMMANDS\" trial, in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients in the first half of 2018. Enrollment is also currently ongoing in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder. If luspatercept were to receive regulatory approval for each of these indications in the United States and Europe, we believe that there is an aggregate sales opportunity for this product in excess of $2 billion.  For sotatercept, we announced in September 2017 that Celgene granted us the rights to fund, develop, and lead the global commercialization of sotatercept in pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. If sotatercept is commercialized to treat PAH and we recognize such revenue, then Celgene will be eligible to receive a royalty in the low 20% range on global net sales. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with PAH in the first half of 2018.  For luspatercept and, outside of pulmonary hypertension, sotatercept, Celgene is responsible for paying 100% of the development costs for all clinical trials. ACE-083 is designed for the treatment of focal muscle disorders, and we are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, or FSHD, as well as in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT. In January 2018, we announced preliminary results for the first two cohorts in part 1 of the Phase 2 clinical trial with ACE-083 in patients with FSHD showing marked increases in the mean total muscle volume of the muscles treated with ACE-083 measured using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. We expect to initiate part 2 of the ACE-083 FSHD Phase 2 trial during the second quarter of this year, and we expect to report preliminary results from all dose-escalation cohorts of part 1 in our FSHD and CMT Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in the second half of this year.  In addition to our mid- to late-stage clinical programs, we initiated a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study in early 2018 with ACE-2494, our wholly-owned systemic muscle agent from our proprietary platform technology, IntelliTrap\u2122, and we expect to report initial results from this healthy volunteer study in the first half of 2019. We are also conducting research within our three focused disease areas\u2014hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary\u2014in order to identify new therapeutic candidates to advance into clinical trials.  As of December 31, 2017 our operations have been funded primarily by $105.1 million in equity investments from venture investors, $539.7 million from public investors, $123.7 million in equity investments from our collaboration partners and $273.7 million in upfront payments, milestones, and net research and development payments from our collaboration partners.

Alkermes has a diversified portfolio of marketed drug products and a clinical pipeline of products that address central nervous system (\"CNS\") disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis (\"MS\"). Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Alkermes has a research and development (\"R & D\") center in Waltham, Massachusetts; an R & D and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland; and a manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio.

ARISTADA ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release intramuscular injectable suspension approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia. ARISTADA is the first of our products to utilize our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is the first atypical antipsychotic with once-monthly, once-every-six-weeks and once-every-two-months dosing options to deliver and maintain therapeutic levels of medication in the body. ARISTADA has four dosing options (441 mg, 662 mg, 882 mg and 1064 mg) and is packaged in a ready-to-use, pre-filled product format. ARISTADA 1064 mg, our two-month dosing option, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") in June 2017. We developed ARISTADA and manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.  Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder. The disease is marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal), as well as by disorganized thinking. An estimated 2.4 million Americans over the age of 18 have schizophrenia in a given year, with men and women affected equally. Worldwide, it is estimated that one person in every 100 develops schizophrenia. Studies have demonstrated that as many as 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty taking their oral medication on a regular basis, which can lead to worsening of symptoms.  VIVITROL VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly, non-narcotic, injectable medication approved in the U.S., Russia and certain countries of the CIS for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one intramuscular injection every four weeks. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL. What are opioid dependence and alcohol dependence?  Opioid dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by compulsive, prolonged self-administration of opioid substances that are not used for a medical purpose.",

There has been an increase in supply of newly constructed self-storage facilities in several of our markets, most notably Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, and New York.  Ownership and operation of self- storage facilities is highly fragmented.

We believe that we have significant market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers, with approximately 71 % of our 201 7 same-store revenues generated in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (each, an \"MSA\", as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) with the highest population levels. Industry fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.

The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

Acer also supports and participates in the EICC\u2019s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. \n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: \n\nSupplier risk assessment \n\nAcer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers\u2019 operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer\u2019s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer\u2019s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code.",

This means not purchasing products known to be manufactured by the use of: forced labor, abusive labor practices, child labor, or other practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured.\u201d\n\nGiven the largely closeout nature of much of the Company\u2019s merchandise, its price points, and the ever-changing nature and composition of the merchandise it purchases and offers for sale, it is not feasible for the Company to comprehensively verify product supply chains or audit supplier compliance, but the Company does send its own employees to a number of the overseas factories from which it buys product for tours and announced inspections. Further, the Company also requires its direct suppliers to certify, in writing, that their products sold to the Company are not the result of any proscribed practices and that the supplier complies with the laws of all countries in which the supplier does business. In fact, the Company\u2019s vendor contracts contain the following requirement:\n\n\u201cIt is Purchaser\u2019s policy not to purchase products manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices, such as forced labor, abusive labor practices, or child labor. Neither will Purchaser buy merchandise made as a result of any practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured.

Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery.

Certifications are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. Abbott maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

        "source": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \n\nHuman trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

The EICC has published the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC Code) which establishes conduct standards for global ICT companies to improve working and environmental conditions. Acer actively works as part of the EICC to provide safeguards which prohibit supply chain use of slavery and human trafficking. \n\nAcer has adopted the EICC Code and requires adherence to this Code by its employees and direct suppliers. Acer also supports and participates in the EICC\u2019s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. \n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: \n\nSupplier risk assessment \n\nAcer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers\u2019 operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer\u2019s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer\u2019s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code.",

First neither of us or any of our guest have ever smoked anything in or around the building and definitely not in our apartment. Also I am currently 8 months pregnant and we are scheduled to move out of our current apartment into another apartment run by the same management a few weeks after my due date. I am very concerned because we seem to have no way to prove our case, not only that, it would greatly effect our lives to have our lease terminated for this reason since it would mean us not being able to move into our new place at the end of september, and it would most likely prevent us from being able to find a new place to move into since the vacancy rate in our city is already about 0.5% so landlords can be extremely picky. I will obviously be talking with the building manager/landlord as soon as possible, however this is really stressing me out as I don't know how I am supposed to prove that I haven't been smoking and there seems to be nothing stopping these people from complaining again since they have done so in the past.

Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery.

Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million U.S. dollars, to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. \n\nAcer is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), an alliance of the world\u2019s leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. The EICC has published the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC Code) which establishes conduct standards for global ICT companies to improve working and environmental conditions. Acer actively works as part of the EICC to provide safeguards which prohibit supply chain use of slavery and human trafficking. \n\nAcer has adopted the EICC Code and requires adherence to this Code by its employees and direct suppliers. Acer also supports and participates in the EICC\u2019s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. \n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: \n\nSupplier risk assessment \n\nAcer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers\u2019 operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer\u2019s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer\u2019s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code.",

It can also be a means of political coercion or as punishment for holding or expressing political views.\n\nForced or compulsory labor is virtually globally banned. The ILO's 1930 Forced Labor Convention (No. 29) as well as the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention (No. 105) are the most widely endorsed of all international labor conventions.\n\nFor more information, see: http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm and http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/Events/ILOevents/lang--en/WCMS_092176/index.htm\n\nWhat is Human Trafficking?\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly resolution 55/25 of 15 November 2000 defines Trafficking in Persons as:\n\nThe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

All employees are required to acknowledge their commitment to understand and comply with the Compliance Management Policy and Procedure.

Both my online application and written confirmation confirm that I was given in-state status.  Well, Summer classes roll around and my bill is for $4000 instead of $2000. I figured it was some early billing for Fall or something (they don't have an easy way to see an itemized bill) but I called to confirm after a couple weeks. Turns out someone made a mistake and I was actually considered out of state. They in no way contacted me to confirm this before I was given my bill. At this point, Summer classes have started. Eventually, I am told that they are working a way out for me to still get in-state tuition. I ask when I can see those changes reflected in my bill, and I get no response. It's been about a month and I haven't heard anything back from them despite my multiple attempts at contact. Now we have long passed the point where I can even get a partial refund and my bill still hasn't changed. I would have withdrawn immediately had I not been told repeatedly that everything would be okay. I have everything in writing and I'm wondering what all I can do.

This type of barbell is also made for women with different specifications; shorter length and thinner diameter, as these characteristics are better suited for female athletes/exercisers. Our recreation center does not provide an equal amount, or even one, women's weightlifting bar. We have plenty of female students that would benefit from having them.

        "source": "I am currently residing in Florida  In April, I made the personal decision to leave my apartment due to personal conflicts with my roommate. We are both on the lease and I asked to either have my name removed from the lease, or to terminate all together. She refused to comply with either of those options out of spite. There is no contractual agreement between me and my roommate stating that we would pay our share of the rent, only a contract with the landlord(the lease). I have been paying the second half of the rent out of fear of what may happen if I choose to stop. From what I understand reading Florida law and finding bits and pieces, the landlord would undergo this process to collect rent: Once the rent is X amount of days late, the landlord will file a 3-Day eviction notice. The tenants will have 3 days to either pay the late rent, vacate the apartment, or fight the eviction in court. Now with that being said, having the eviction to my renter's history IS NOT A BOTHERSOME to me. I also understand the landlord may sue for missing rent. Being evicted and having to pay overdue rent for the month sounds like a better deal to me than continuing to pay rent for an apartment I'm not living in until December. My main concern is the retaliation of my roommate, and fact checking the eviction process. Is there anything legally she may pursue in a small claims court against me directly beings that there is no contractual agreement directly between the two of us, stating we would split the rent? Is there any actions that the landlord may take that is much more serve than eviction/suing for missing rent? Does my roommate have a case to fight the eviction in court?",

        "source": "(suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was \"I'll talk to you when I get back\" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying \"I'm too sick to work\" contradicts \"The way you run this place is inhospitable for me\".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?",

Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery.

Abbott requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Abbott\u2019s products comply with local and national laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Certifications are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. Abbott maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

        "source": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \n\nHuman trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million U.S. dollars, to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. \n\nAcer is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), an alliance of the world\u2019s leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. The EICC has published the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC Code) which establishes conduct standards for global ICT companies to improve working and environmental conditions. Acer actively works as part of the EICC to provide safeguards which prohibit supply chain use of slavery and human trafficking. \n\nAcer has adopted the EICC Code and requires adherence to this Code by its employees and direct suppliers. Acer also supports and participates in the EICC\u2019s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. \n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: \n\nSupplier risk assessment \n\nAcer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers\u2019 operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices.

The system uses a combination of four approaches to accomplish the compliance verification process. These approaches are: Sustainability Self Assessments, Risk Evaluations performed by the responsible Siemens Buyer, Sustainability Audits performed by third parties and Siemens Quality audits. These audits include determining if the supplier adheres to the Code of Conduct. Further information on our systematic approach can be found at www.siemens.com/sr/detection-modules \u2028Siemens Management System considers the assessment and audit findings and then employs supplier development actions which establish improvement measures to be taken by suppliers to mitigate or correct issues raised in audit findings. If a supplier fails to execute the agreed upon measures, Siemens may terminate any existing business with the supplier. This termination right is established in Siemens supplier contracts and purchase terms and conditions. \n\n \n\nThe number of 3rd party audits and number of findings are published in the Siemens Sustainability Report, and can be accessed through the following links: (www.siemens.com/scm/sustainability; or specific suppliers chapter under : http://www.siemens.com/sustainability/pool/en/current-reporting/sr2010_suppliers.pdf).\n\nEnergy Efficiency Program for Suppliers\n\nIn order to orient our entire supply chain in an ecological manner, we work closely with our suppliers to identify and implement measures for the efficient use of resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we developed our Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers (EEP4Suppliers) which provides access to know-how and experience from our own Environmental Program and Environmental Portfolio.\n\nIn fiscal 2010, we successfully piloted EEP4Suppliers at 17 production facilities operated by major suppliers. Plans call for the first 1,000 suppliers to be integrated in the EEP4Suppliers program by the end of fiscal 2012.\n\nOrganization Awareness.\n\nAll Procurement professionals within the Siemens Supply Chain organization are trained on the \u201cOne Supplier Certification\u201d process and related Code of Conduct requirements so that the principles can be effectively explained to suppliers. Additionally Siemens conducts sustainability workshops with our suppliers in higher-risk-countries. The workshops include presentations by Environment, Health and Safety Officers who lead break-out sessions that address human right topics such as worker safety.\n\nWeb Based Trainings in Sustainability are available for suppliers as well as internal Siemens personnel and can be accessed through the following link. https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx\n\n* This information explains Siemens activities in support of and commitment to the principles found in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from supply chains.",

This means not purchasing products known to be manufactured by the use of: forced labor, abusive labor practices, child labor, or other practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured.\u201d\n\nGiven the largely closeout nature of much of the Company\u2019s merchandise, its price points, and the ever-changing nature and composition of the merchandise it purchases and offers for sale, it is not feasible for the Company to comprehensively verify product supply chains or audit supplier compliance, but the Company does send its own employees to a number of the overseas factories from which it buys product for tours and announced inspections. Further, the Company also requires its direct suppliers to certify, in writing, that their products sold to the Company are not the result of any proscribed practices and that the supplier complies with the laws of all countries in which the supplier does business. In fact, the Company\u2019s vendor contracts contain the following requirement:\n\n\u201cIt is Purchaser\u2019s policy not to purchase products manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices, such as forced labor, abusive labor practices, or child labor. Neither will Purchaser buy merchandise made as a result of any practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured. By signing or shipping under 99 Cents\u2019 PO, Seller attests to the fact that after a diligent inquiry, Seller has ascertained that no product that is the subject of this Purchase Order has been manufactured using any such forced, involuntary, exploitive, or unfair labor practices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Any supplier found to have falsely certified its compliance with the Company\u2019s policy will no longer be used by the Company as one of its vendors. The Company\u2019s buyers are also expected to comply with this policy, although it is not feasible for the Company to maintain a formal accountability program or to provide regular training on these topics to employees and managers operating in these areas, for the same reasons explained above.",

It is our expectation that our suppliers also conduct themselves in such a manner. Pursuant to its obligations as a government contractor under FAR sec 22.1700 et seq., Aethercomm has adopted a zero-tolerance policy regarding slavery and trafficking in persons. All Aethercomm employees, contractors, subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers, and employees or agents thereof, are prohibited from engaging in any form of slavery or human trafficking, including but not limited to:\n\nEngaging in trafficking of persons as defined by: the laws of the United States; the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children; and all other applicable laws;\n\nEngaging in severe forms of trafficking in persons, as defined by Section 22.1702 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;\n\nProcuring commercial sex acts, as defined by Section 22.1702 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;\n\nUsing forced labor, as defined in Section 22.1702 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n\nAny Employee who violates this policy, or who willfully, knowingly or negligently allows subordinates to do the same, will be terminated. Likewise, any contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or vendor who violates this policy, or who willfully, knowingly or negligently allows subordinates to do the same, will have their respective contracts terminated. Suspected violations will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. \n\nAll Aethercomm employees, vendors, and direct suppliers are notified of this policy and the consequences of violating it. Aethercomm requires all vendors and direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into their products comply with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries where they are doing business. Aethercomm further requires all vendors and direct suppliers to comply with FAR Section 52.222-50 \u201cCombating Trafficking in Persons.\u201d Aethercomm does not conduct independent audits of supply chains as enforcement of the Federal Acquisition Regulation falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Government. \n\nAethercomm does not have a training program in human trafficking mitigation at this time.

Basically ended up in the hospital super drunk, freaked out, accidentally injured a nurse while they were trying to restrain me. I woke up still intoxicated with a police officer instructing me to sign a piece of paper. I did that then I passed back out. When I next woke up there was a doctor there who told me what had happened and that the nurse I accidentally hurt didn't want to press charges.  I hired an attorney and found out (I believe my attorney told me) that the police officer was also trying to charge me with assault and battery. A few days later I showed up at the local court house with my attorney. He spoke to the judge who decided to get rid of the misdemeanor Minor in Consumption and battery charge and instead give me one charge of Disturbing the Peace. I informally plead guilty by telling my attorney to take the deal. I then paid a fine, and that was that. My attorney also mentioned that, because my battery charge hadn't been formally written up and filed yet, it wouldn't show up on my criminal record. Does that sound accurate and plausible?  Now, back to my main question: how can this all be on my file if I never remember having my fingerprints or a mugshot taken? They wouldn't have done that in the hospital, right? I would have had to have been booked into jail?  I'm also an Elementary Education major and I've taken two fingerprint checks, neither of which have come up with anything that the Board of Education found bad enough to bar me from teaching.

Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.  The power supply is a \"high end\" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.  My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc)   I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)  Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.  The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.  I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.  I have been in contact with a seemingly helpful/friendly person from the PSU company and had originally shipped them my motherboard for further inspection. I have not yet heard back their diagnosis on the motherboard but regardless I will not be using it again.  I emailed them today and explained everything ive done and money it has cost me and i've asked what they can do for me.   If they don't offer a reasonable settlement to this matter is it a good idea to sue them in small claims court? I have spent many hours troubleshooting and dealing with this system including loss of productivity at work from having to use my laptop which is not ideal for IT work.

Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery. Abbott\u2019s internal Code of Business Conduct also incorporates standards prohibiting slavery/trafficking or engaging in illegal behavior. Abbott requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Abbott\u2019s products comply with local and national laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Certifications are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. Abbott maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. In particular, Abbott employees worldwide train annually on Abbott\u2019s Code of Business Conduct. Likewise, all contractors assigned to Abbott are required to review and abide by Abbott\u2019s Code of Business Conduct.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEmployees and contractors assigned to Abbott who fail to abide by Abbott\u2019s Code of Business Conduct may be subject to reprimand or other adverse consequences, up to and including termination of employment or assignment. Abbott provides training to its employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, regarding human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.",

        "source": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \n\nHuman trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

Due to the huge diversity of conditions at the 177 countries in which we purchased goods and services in the last Fiscal Year (Oct 1st - Sept 30), this maxim of Siemens\u2018 business policy was considered in the principles of the \u201cCode of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers\u201d. It is based on \u2013 among others \u2013 the UN Global Compact and the principles of the International Labor Organization but also reflects the Siemens \u201cBusiness Conduct Guidelines\u201d, which establishes fundamental principles of sustainability and apply to the entire company.\n\nSiemens operates not only in accordance with clear Business Conduct Guidelines, which are mandatory worldwide, but also with directives to concentrate business with only the best suppliers who agree to and comply with our standards in the supply chain. In the long term we cooperate only with suppliers who place as much value on Sustainability as we do and who adhere to the principles of Global Compact with respect to human rights and work relationships.\n\nIn order to continuously monitor and improve the performance of our suppliers we utilize a consistent Supplier Management System. At the foundation of this system is our process by which we obtain supplier contractual commitment to responsibilities towards their stakeholders and the environment through the Siemens Supplier Code of Conduct. The code addresses the following concepts:\n\n\t\tCompliance with laws. \n\n\t\tProhibition of Corruption and Bribery \n\n\t\tRespect for Basic Human Rights of Employees (which includes to refuse to employ or make \u2028anyone work against his or her will) \n\n\t\tProhibition of Child Labor \n\n\t\tHealth and Safety of Employees \n\n\t\tEnvironmental Protection \n\n\t\tPromotion of the above principles in the supply chain of the supplier \u2028The full Supplier Code of Conduct document and detailed description of the key provisions can be found under the following link: https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx) \u2028Once a supplier becomes part of the Siemens supply chain, it then becomes subject to the compliance verification activities established as part of the Supplier Management System. The system uses a combination of four approaches to accomplish the compliance verification process. These approaches are: Sustainability Self Assessments, Risk Evaluations performed by the responsible Siemens Buyer, Sustainability Audits performed by third parties and Siemens Quality audits. These audits include determining if the supplier adheres to the Code of Conduct. Further information on our systematic approach can be found at www.siemens.com/sr/detection-modules \u2028Siemens Management System considers the assessment and audit findings and then employs supplier development actions which establish improvement measures to be taken by suppliers to mitigate or correct issues raised in audit findings. If a supplier fails to execute the agreed upon measures, Siemens may terminate any existing business with the supplier. This termination right is established in Siemens supplier contracts and purchase terms and conditions. \n\n \n\nThe number of 3rd party audits and number of findings are published in the Siemens Sustainability Report, and can be accessed through the following links: (www.siemens.com/scm/sustainability; or specific suppliers chapter under : http://www.siemens.com/sustainability/pool/en/current-reporting/sr2010_suppliers.pdf).\n\nEnergy Efficiency Program for Suppliers\n\nIn order to orient our entire supply chain in an ecological manner, we work closely with our suppliers to identify and implement measures for the efficient use of resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we developed our Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers (EEP4Suppliers) which provides access to know-how and experience from our own Environmental Program and Environmental Portfolio.\n\nIn fiscal 2010, we successfully piloted EEP4Suppliers at 17 production facilities operated by major suppliers. Plans call for the first 1,000 suppliers to be integrated in the EEP4Suppliers program by the end of fiscal 2012.\n\nOrganization Awareness.\n\nAll Procurement professionals within the Siemens Supply Chain organization are trained on the \u201cOne Supplier Certification\u201d process and related Code of Conduct requirements so that the principles can be effectively explained to suppliers. Additionally Siemens conducts sustainability workshops with our suppliers in higher-risk-countries. The workshops include presentations by Environment, Health and Safety Officers who lead break-out sessions that address human right topics such as worker safety.\n\nWeb Based Trainings in Sustainability are available for suppliers as well as internal Siemens personnel and can be accessed through the following link. https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx\n\n* This information explains Siemens activities in support of and commitment to the principles found in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from supply chains.",

This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million U.S. dollars, to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. \n\nAcer is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), an alliance of the world\u2019s leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. The EICC has published the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC Code) which establishes conduct standards for global ICT companies to improve working and environmental conditions. Acer actively works as part of the EICC to provide safeguards which prohibit supply chain use of slavery and human trafficking. \n\nAcer has adopted the EICC Code and requires adherence to this Code by its employees and direct suppliers. Acer also supports and participates in the EICC\u2019s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. \n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: \n\nSupplier risk assessment \n\nAcer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers\u2019 operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer\u2019s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer\u2019s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code.",

        "source": "To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old.   So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year.   So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They \"train\" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in.   She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice.   So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she \"didn't have the look for it.\" The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers.   Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week.   So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however.   So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her.   She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid.   My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously.   Sorry for the long patchy story.   tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was.",

Apparently we have received a ticket before (I, along with a couple of my other corkers, have no knowledge of this) and it was paid for by the company.

To avoid paying either of these people overtime, when they are working 60-80 hour weeks. He has been doing this for some time. He gets around paying them overtime by sending 2 checks, each from a different store. He has also payed many employees in cash/ with a personal check in place of a paycheck in order to keep the taxes that were taken out for himself. I have hard evidence of this too, even though it has never happened to me.

(they worked together at the same company so she found his number through mutual friends on Facebook) Anyway, when she was 6 months pregnant she said to him that it might be his but then weeks later said it wasn't and that she had slept with two other men that same week and that he shouldn't worry. Well she called two weeks ago for the first time in 2 years and insisted it was his, wants child support and that he should come and do a paternity test immediately. My boyfriend only told me this yesterday, I've never seen him this nervous and upset.   The problem is, is that we live in a different country now. Have been for 3 years.  So he would have to fly a 13 hour flight and pay for the expensive test. Well he doesn't have to but is scared she might go to court, convince them that its his and put a block on his passport or a warrant for his arrest.

Long story short, the artist showed up 3 hours late and only performed for 10 minutes, if that. T-Shirts were distributed, but posters were not.  The refund policy set by the entertainment company (and restated through Eventbrite) was no refunds. I submitted a refund request through Eventbrite anyway but it is stated that it is at the discretion of the entertainment company to respond to the request if they want to.  I'm considering disputing the transaction through Bank of America as I made the purchase through credit card. Do I have grounds for a chargeback or dispute for bad services rendered? I realize that the bank will ask if I tried to contact the merchant first, but with a no refunds policy it seems unlikely that either Eventbrite or the entertainment company would respond.

I didn't think I did, and saw no evidence of damage to my car. I asked her if she wanted to file a police report, she said no. I gave her my information, never admitting fault, but not wanting to be accused of fleeing the scene of an accident. I let her take a picture of my insurance and my license, but it had my old address (I had literally just moved that day). I did not provide my new address or phone/email. When my insurance agency called, I disputed the claim and gave my version of events to the best of my ability. A few days later they called and said they were not claiming liability on the accident. Hooray, I thought I was done with this. Today, I received a letter from the state police. It has a driver Information Exchange and an Illinois Motorist Report enclosed, asking me to mail it to the department of transportation.  The reason that I'm worried is because, due to an issue with an emission test, my car's registration was expired on the date of the alleged collision. Because of that, I have a few outstanding tickets for registration violation that are currently sitting on seizure (they will boot me if they find the car). My car is currently parked in my garage until I can save enough to pay the tickets and re-register. I also have not yet reported my change of address to the DMV. I'm worried that this lady's meddling is going to get me in trouble with the DOT.  I know there's a lot there. What is my best course of action for responding to this letter?

Compared to the relevant labor market, the Infosys workforce was composed of a remarkably disproportionate share of South Asians, and similarly a remarkably disproportionate share of Indians (a slightly narrower group than South Asians). Across the different analyses this report covers, these percentages were approximately 89%, [*27]  versus about 11%-20% in the relevant labor market. Infosys hires were also disproportionately South Asian or Indian to a remarkable degree\u2014approximately 75%, versus approximately 11%-20% of employees in the relevant labor market. The applicants to Infosys were also highly disproportionately South Asian or Indian. Despite an employment share of about 11%-20% South Asian or Indian in the relevant labor market, Infosys' applicants were around 45% South Asian or Indian. And even when it received applicants who were not South Asian or Indian, Infosys was more likely to offer jobs to applicants who were South Asian or Indian. The apparent favorable treatment of South Asians or Indians continued once employment commenced. Promotion rates for South Asian or Indian employees were about 58%, compared to around 21% for non-South Asian or non-Indian employees. Separation rates of non-South Asian or non-Indian employees were much higher\u2014approximately 51% versus 8%\u2014and in particular the rate of company-initiated separations was double for non-South Asians or non-Indians\u2014about 23% versus 11% for South Asians or Indians.

I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to \"lawyer up\" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?

I will obviously be talking with the building manager/landlord as soon as possible, however this is really stressing me out as I don't know how I am supposed to prove that I haven't been smoking and there seems to be nothing stopping these people from complaining again since they have done so in the past.

The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices.

This law was designed to increase the amount of information made available by companies with regard to efforts to eradicate forced labor and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.\n\nForced labor and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. BCBGMAXAZRIA has a zero-tolerance policy for both forced labor and child labor and we are committed to ensuring that our supply chain reflects our respect for human rights.\n\nOur relationships with suppliers are based on lawful, efficient and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws that require them to treat workers fairly, and provide a safe and healthy work environment. We require our manufacturing facilities to confirm in writing that they conform to these standards, and we maintain a file of these certifications.\n\nWe also reserve the right to make periodic, unannounced inspections of our suppliers\u2019 facilities to verify each supplier\u2019s compliance with our sourcing guidelines and other requirements. Such on-site inspections are conducted by either our internal team or by a third party company, and we reserve the right to terminate the relationship with any supplier who fails to comply with our requirements.",

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. aims to cooperate with its vendors and their subcontractors on a systematic, long term basis to ensure our sourced merchandise is produced under socially responsible conditions.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond Inc. is constantly looking for ways to improve in the area of corporate social responsibility.\u00a0 In connection with this effort, we encourage our vendors to adopt a comprehensive program of responsible practices and to prepare a corporate responsibility (or \u201csustainability\u201d) report if they do not already do so.\u00a0\n\nAll vendors and their factories must follow our \"Code of Conduct\", which details our policies in regard to child labor, involuntary labor, human trafficking, disciplinary practices, non-discrimination, health and safety, environmental protection, wages and benefits, working hours, employee relations, and other items.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nThe Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Code of Conduct summarizes the basic requirements concerning working conditions that must be satisfied by each vendor for every location. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. reserves the right to change and supplement the Code of Conduct at any time.\n\nVendors shall familiarize workers with the Code of Conduct and display it, translated in the local language, at each of their facilities in a place readily visible and accessible to workers. Vendors shall ensure that their contractors and suppliers adhere to the Code of Conduct.\n\nChild Labor\n\nVendors shall not use child labor. The international standard for defining \u201cChild Labor\u201d is found in the International Labor Organizations\u2019 Convention 138 on Minimum Age for Employment (1973) which provides as follows:\u00a0 \u201cThe minimum age [\u2026] should not be less than the age of compulsory schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 years.\u201d If the country of production has a more restrictive definition of child labor, then Bed Bath & Beyond will not produce product made by persons in violation of that country\u2019s laws. Vendors must verify the age of their workers and maintain copies of their workers\u2019 proof of age.\u00a0\u00a0 Vendors must follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding working hours and conditions for minors. \n\nInvoluntary Labor\n\nVendor shall not use involuntary labor. \u201cInvoluntary Labor\u201d is defined as work or service which is extracted from any person under threat or penalty for its non-performance and for which the worker does not offer himself or herself voluntarily, and includes all manner of prison, bonded, indentured and forced labor.\n\nHuman Trafficking \n\nVendors and all direct suppliers to such Vendors shall comply with the laws addressing human trafficking and slavery of the country or countries where the Vendors do business. For purposes of this Code of Conduct, the operative standard for defining \u201cHuman trafficking\u201d is taken from the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol):\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c[\u2026] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.\u00a0\u00a0 Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, [or] servitude; [\u2026]\u201d\n\nVendors shall certify that they have implemented procedures to manage all aspects of the supply chain to ensure they comply with laws on slavery and human trafficking. Workers must be allowed to maintain control over their identity documents.\n\nHealth and Safety\n\nVendors shall provide workers with a clean, safe, and healthy workplace in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe work environment must be safe and sanitary to ensure there are no unreasonable risks to the health and safety of all workers. Factories must implement procedures and safeguards to prevent accidents and injuries to workers; procedures and safeguards include, but are not limited to, inspection of buildings, machinery, and fire extinguishers. Regular and recorded health and safety training shall be provided for all new or reassigned workers and management.\n\nVendors shall ensure that workers have access to clean drinking water, sanitary washing facilities, and an adequate number of toilets.\n\nAisles, exits, and stairwells must be kept unblocked at all times. The workplaces must provide adequate lighting and ventilation.\n\nVendors must maintain appropriate chemical safety ensuring proper chemical storage, eye wash stations, and Personal Protective Equipment for workers, as applicable.\n\nEnvironmental Protection\n\nVendors should ensure that every manufacturing facility complies with environmental laws, including all laws related to waste disposal, air emissions, discharges, toxic substances, and hazardous waste disposal, as well as procedures for notifying local authorities in the event of an environmental accident resulting from the Vendor\u2019s operations.\n\nFactories must take steps to ensure that all input materials and components were obtained from permissible sources consistent with international treaties and local laws and regulations. Appropriate and adequate environmental training should be provided to all workers and management.\n\nWages and Benefits\n\nVendors shall provide wages and benefits that comply with all applicable laws and regulations or match the prevailing local manufacturing or industry rates, whichever is higher. Overtime pay shall be calculated at the legally required rate, regardless of whether workers are compensated hourly or by piece rate.\n\nFactories must compensate all workers in accordance with the law and where applicable with contractual agreements. Workers must be provided with written and understandable details regarding their employment and compensation.\n\nWorking Hours\n\nVendors shall not require workers to work, including overtime, more than 60 hours per week or more than any maximum number of hours per week established by applicable laws and regulations, whichever is less. Vendors shall guarantee that workers receive at least one day off during each seven day period.\n\nEmployee Relations\n\nVendors shall respect the right of workers to take advantage of any laws relating to employee management relations.\n\nDormitories and Canteen\n\nFactories that provide residential and dining facilities for their workers must provide safe, healthy, and sanitary facilities.\n\nAll areas of the dormitory facilities shall be kept secure, clean and have safety provisions (such as fire extinguishers, first aid kits, unobstructed emergency exits, emergency lighting, etc.). Emergency evacuation drills shall be conducted at least once a year. Additionally, Factories shall provide appropriate washroom facilities, including adequate toilets and showers segregated by gender. The facility should also have security measures to protect employees and their property.\u00a0 Dormitories must be in compliance with all housing laws and regulations, occupancy requirements, and health and safety laws. \n\nLegal Requirements\n\nVendors shall comply with all legal requirements applicable to the conduct of their businesses, including those set out above.\n\nManagement at the Company has also participated in webinars and attended presentations organized by reputable third party industry groups with respect to the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Internal team members with direct responsibility for supply chain have also participated in training on slavery and human trafficking.\n\nSocial Compliance Audits\n\nThough the amount of product sold in our stores that is imported directly by us is a very small portion of our business, Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, and Harmon, Harmon Face Values have developed a Social Compliance Audit Program for all vendors of direct import merchandise.\u00a0 In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY have instituted the same requirements for vendors of private label products whether imported or domestically sourced.\u00a0 The requirements of the Social Compliance Audit Program are communicated to vendors through our Quality Assurance Manual.\n\nAll vendors or Buying/Selling Agents are required to be fully knowledgeable of all factories and labor arrangements used in the production of goods. \n\nThe Company has partnered with an ISO accredited, worldwide, independent laboratory to implement the Social Compliance Audit Program.\u00a0 Audits initiated by the Company are conducted on a semi-unannounced basis. All vendors or their agents must allow the Company\u2019s partner to conduct both scheduled and unscheduled inspections of their facilities for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct and employee health and safety standards. During audits, the Company maintains the right to, among other things, review all employee related books and records maintained by the vendor and to interview workers outside the presence of factory management.\u00a0 The audit also includes protocols to assess risks of human trafficking and slavery.\u00a0 Any deficiencies identified in a Social Compliance Audit must be remedied within a reasonable timeframe.\u00a0 \n\nAll vendors are required to sign our Import Vendor Compliance Guide Acknowledgment Form, which confirms their acceptance and certifies their compliance with all of the above policies.",

His operations and their effects weren't confined within the territorial limits of a foreign nation. He brought component parts of his wares in the U.S. and Bulovas filtered through the Mexican border into this country. His competing goods reflected adversely on Bulova's trade reputation in markets cultivated here as well as abroad.

Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to \"lawyer up\" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?   And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!   Where do I go from here?",

        "source": "I made friends with a fellow nursing student about a year ago. We got along well for a most of that time until she started acting very strangely so I tried to reduce our interactions to more of an acquaintance level. I still helped her with school work and coached her through some NCLEX practice exams. I made sure to be very non-confrontational as she has mentioned all sorts of mental instability issues in the past and how she hates having any sort of direct confrontation. I have no idea if any claims about depression or anxiety are actually diagnosed.  We ended up with pretty much the SAME EXACT schedule this past semester. So naturally, we would walk to class together and occasionally go to the restroom together. Normal female things. Nothing she did gave me any cause for alarm. I never tried to bother her. I thought it was a simple, functional, school-based friendship.  This is where things get strange. She started acting very distant and would ignore about half the time when I would say hi and she started leaving class for long periods. Then she started leaving whenever I would even be in the same hall way. She'd leave class about a minute before it was over and not make eye contact with anyone. I thought maybe she was having a serious problem so I texted her to see if she was okay. If anything was wrong, etc. If I could help. I may not want to be best friends but when someone acts THAT oddly, maybe just a little compassion can change whatever situation they are in.  She assures me that everything is fine and then started ignoring me completely a few days later. I gave up on trying to figure out what was up or if I could help. I kept to myself. This was a while back.  I get a text about a week ago saying that she feels uncomfortable with how much I stalked her last semester and she didn't think it was okay for me to go to the restroom with her because she felt that I wanted an intimate relationship and would try something.  I told her I was uncomfortable with further contact after telling her it had been a while since I 'stalked' her and that the stalking she was talking about was unavoidable on both of our parts because we had five classes together in the same day. If she was following me or I her, it couldn't have been avoided but that whatever she perceived to be the case was simply us walking to class together. She was the one that showed up on campus on days that she had no classes and went to some of my classes with me (I had seven classes total that semester). I feel like if anyone should be scared of the situation, it should be me. I'm not, though. Just uncomfortable.  I'm worried that since this contact was so out of the blue and so unprovoked with specific details on how I made her feel threatened basically, that she's trying to set me up in some way. I'm genuinely worried because what if she's saying all of that and being so unpredictable because she's about to do something like file a restraining order? That would kill any future I could have as a nurse.  We are both early thirties in Nebraska if that affects regional laws.  What should I do? Save the texts and get a lawyer on retainer just in case? I don't understand why she would just now start doing all of this when we haven't really talked since last semester. This whole situation feels very wrong to me. I know she's a very good manipulator which is one of the main reasons I stopped associating with her so much. This all just feels too odd and specific to mean anything good.  **TL;DR-** Ex-class mate from last semester texts me out of the blue saying that she feels like I was stalking her. Why bring this up now, without ever indicating that feeling before? What should I do to protect myself and my future?",

He has been physically violent for years and has continued to stalk me pretty aggressively throughout our separation. I moved out in Nov. 2016 and officially filed with the courts in Feb. 2017 pro se. He counter petitioned and as I did not have an attorney I was bullied into giving majority custody to him of our daughter. This has proved to be a bad decision as he does not care for her emotional well being and she is now seeing a therapist. He also continues to break the morality clause in our custody orders. I have gone to authorities to attempt to get a Protective Order against him, once with a bruise from him on my body, and they stated that as we are still married and have a child together they thought it best to deny. I have had to fight to get a criminal trespass warning for my home. Since I decided to leave I have been seeing someone else. My boyfriend has been hit multiple times and charges were pressed but they never went anywhere. The local police told him he should just stop seeing me and that I'm getting what I deserve bc I shouldn't be seeing someone while I'm still technically married. On top of physical stalking, he works in IT security and cyber stalks me constantly. He hacks into ALL of my online accounts, wipes or locks out my phone (which he is not on the account or any of my accounts), gets into my bank accounts, paypal etc, and has begun hacking into the network where I work and messing with my payroll stuff as well as posting inappropriate pictures for all of my coworkers to see. Meanwhile, no one will listen to me or acknowledge whats going on no matter what I report. He even reads all my text messages, etc, tracks my whereabouts constantly, and does petty things like driving by my house and setting of my car alarm in the middle of the night. He has recently been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and I feel he is unfit to parent our child. However, I cant afford a retainer for an attorney. I now pay approximately 45% of my income to him for child support, insurance for our daughter, daycare for her while shes with him, and other medical fees each month. My check is already small so this has left me on the brink of homelessness even though I work full time and clean houses on the side. He tells our child awful things like I don't love her and I'm a quote \"fucking whore\" etc constantly which has been very detrimental to her. At this point I'm at my wits end. I feel like no one is listening and I have no where to turn. I would love to free myself and my daughter from this abuse and unsustainable situation, but I don't know what to do. Could anyone tell me how long he can ride this out without signing divorce papers since he counter petitioned? What can I do to lower the amount I pay to him as I am in such dire straits and he makes a few thousand a month more than I do already? Without everything coming out I currently bring home less than a minimum wage employee and cant find an attorney willing to help",

Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid.

I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.",

Issue is below:  Employee declared that they had resigned from their previous place of work when we interviewed them. Been employed for a year (passed probation) and due to a tip off (came from outside the business we believe, somebody from their previous place of work), we have now discovered that they were actually dismissed for fraud from the last employer (when they told us they resigned).   Reference check was done before being offered the position (as per usual), but reason for leaving was not disclosed by the references (we always try and get the reason for leaving if possible). We have no signed documents from the employee confirming their reason for leaving; only written information is interview notes when we interviewed them, but obviously they would not have signed this (and new employees do not normally see their interview notes).  As stated, employee has passed probation so we cannot simply dismiss that easily. Currently suspended employee and waiting for a meeting date, but unsure if we have a case here\u2026 he's suspended with pay so I doubt he's worried, probably just got his feet up at home.  Management does not want this employee working for us any longer given what he was dismissed for in the last company and intentionally did not declare it in this one (and as we are an insurance-based company, something like fraud is obviously going to raise warning flags. As stated he is currently suspended (with pay) and is waiting for a meeting date with his manager and HR. He has no previous warnings or anything as such on his record, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't socialise that much (which can go either way to be honest, if he is up to something with our company then it would make sense to keep to yourself).

The custody agreement was that I would stay with my mom on weekdays, and I would stay at my dads on weekends, but it has always been very, very loose. The past year or so my mother has become more and more touchy, and she yells at me quite often. She gets mad over the tiniest things and starts yelling, and then I start crying, and then she'll yell at me for crying, and then I cry harder, and then it kinda keeps going from there. Usually after that I go hide in my room and cry for at least another hour thinking about how much I hate her and stuff like that. My father is literally the perfect parent. He actually has a job(Mom doesn't), gets stuff done(Mom doesn't), is actually responsible, gets me to school on time, volunteers for all of my band stuff, etc.  and most importantly he never ever yells. Not once in my life have I been yelled at. I practically idolize him and I respect him, whereas I lost respect for my mother a long time ago. About a year ago, I was practically suicidal because of her yelling at me. For the past year, but especially this last week, I've been thinking about going over to dad's and simply telling him that I'm not going back. Today for the first time I actually said something when my dad told me to pack up, and he really does want to help in any way he can. What would happen if I refused to go over to my moms? With the fact that she has yelled at me this much, is a pretty bad parent in general, and that I'm an older kid who has a clear opinion, would there be any chance of changing custody to primarily if not completely my father?

Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery.

        "source": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \n\nHuman trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code.

Due to the huge diversity of conditions at the 177 countries in which we purchased goods and services in the last Fiscal Year (Oct 1st - Sept 30), this maxim of Siemens\u2018 business policy was considered in the principles of the \u201cCode of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers\u201d. It is based on \u2013 among others \u2013 the UN Global Compact and the principles of the International Labor Organization but also reflects the Siemens \u201cBusiness Conduct Guidelines\u201d, which establishes fundamental principles of sustainability and apply to the entire company.\n\nSiemens operates not only in accordance with clear Business Conduct Guidelines, which are mandatory worldwide, but also with directives to concentrate business with only the best suppliers who agree to and comply with our standards in the supply chain. In the long term we cooperate only with suppliers who place as much value on Sustainability as we do and who adhere to the principles of Global Compact with respect to human rights and work relationships.\n\nIn order to continuously monitor and improve the performance of our suppliers we utilize a consistent Supplier Management System. At the foundation of this system is our process by which we obtain supplier contractual commitment to responsibilities towards their stakeholders and the environment through the Siemens Supplier Code of Conduct. The code addresses the following concepts:\n\n\t\tCompliance with laws. \n\n\t\tProhibition of Corruption and Bribery \n\n\t\tRespect for Basic Human Rights of Employees (which includes to refuse to employ or make \u2028anyone work against his or her will) \n\n\t\tProhibition of Child Labor \n\n\t\tHealth and Safety of Employees \n\n\t\tEnvironmental Protection \n\n\t\tPromotion of the above principles in the supply chain of the supplier \u2028The full Supplier Code of Conduct document and detailed description of the key provisions can be found under the following link: https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx) \u2028Once a supplier becomes part of the Siemens supply chain, it then becomes subject to the compliance verification activities established as part of the Supplier Management System. The system uses a combination of four approaches to accomplish the compliance verification process. These approaches are: Sustainability Self Assessments, Risk Evaluations performed by the responsible Siemens Buyer, Sustainability Audits performed by third parties and Siemens Quality audits. These audits include determining if the supplier adheres to the Code of Conduct. Further information on our systematic approach can be found at www.siemens.com/sr/detection-modules \u2028Siemens Management System considers the assessment and audit findings and then employs supplier development actions which establish improvement measures to be taken by suppliers to mitigate or correct issues raised in audit findings. If a supplier fails to execute the agreed upon measures, Siemens may terminate any existing business with the supplier. This termination right is established in Siemens supplier contracts and purchase terms and conditions. \n\n \n\nThe number of 3rd party audits and number of findings are published in the Siemens Sustainability Report, and can be accessed through the following links: (www.siemens.com/scm/sustainability; or specific suppliers chapter under : http://www.siemens.com/sustainability/pool/en/current-reporting/sr2010_suppliers.pdf).\n\nEnergy Efficiency Program for Suppliers\n\nIn order to orient our entire supply chain in an ecological manner, we work closely with our suppliers to identify and implement measures for the efficient use of resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we developed our Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers (EEP4Suppliers) which provides access to know-how and experience from our own Environmental Program and Environmental Portfolio.\n\nIn fiscal 2010, we successfully piloted EEP4Suppliers at 17 production facilities operated by major suppliers. Plans call for the first 1,000 suppliers to be integrated in the EEP4Suppliers program by the end of fiscal 2012.\n\nOrganization Awareness.\n\nAll Procurement professionals within the Siemens Supply Chain organization are trained on the \u201cOne Supplier Certification\u201d process and related Code of Conduct requirements so that the principles can be effectively explained to suppliers. Additionally Siemens conducts sustainability workshops with our suppliers in higher-risk-countries. The workshops include presentations by Environment, Health and Safety Officers who lead break-out sessions that address human right topics such as worker safety.\n\nWeb Based Trainings in Sustainability are available for suppliers as well as internal Siemens personnel and can be accessed through the following link. https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx\n\n* This information explains Siemens activities in support of and commitment to the principles found in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from supply chains.",

Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk.

        "source": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \n\nHuman trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices.

The Act requires retailers and manufacturers that do business in California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. Big Lots is committed to ensuring that its supply chain reflects its values and respect for human rights. To that end, Big Lots requires that its suppliers, their contractors and their subcontractors certify that they agree to and fully comply with, the standards listed in Big Lots\u2019 Standards for Suppliers (\u201cStandards for Suppliers\u201d).\n\nThe Standards for Suppliers requires that suppliers comply with the legal requirements and standards of their industry under the local and national laws of the jurisdictions in which the suppliers are doing business, including the labor and employment laws of those jurisdictions, and any applicable U.S. laws. Furthermore, the Standards for Suppliers states that Big Lots will not accept products from suppliers who utilize in any manner child labor, forced labor or prison labor in the manufacturer of its products.\n\nBig Lots favors suppliers who have a social and political commitment to basic principles of human rights and who do not discriminate against their employees in hiring practices, or any other term or condition of work, on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability or other similar factors.\n\nIn order to monitor compliance with its Standards for Suppliers, Big Lots or its designee inspects its suppliers\u2019 production facilities. Big Lots requires that its suppliers disclose the locations of their factories where its merchandise is being produced in order that either Big Lots or its designee may inspect the factories to ensure good practices and adherence to the Standards for Suppliers.\n\nBig Lots expects its employees who have responsibility in supply chain management to have read the Standards for Suppliers.",

That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.

It's a pretty sweet deal, because I get to live in campus apartments for free, on top of having a full time job. I have a second job as well. This summer, I'm working with the catering crew in the dining hall. They have lost a few people, leaving us a bit understaffed, and as a result we've been over scheduled and worked over forty hours in one week four times.   We sign in by writing down when we came in and took our breaks, and then we sit down while our boss enters our time in online based on what hours we've worked. However, she lies about when we come in - when we reach overtime, we are told that we're not allowed to work overtime, so we \"have\" to spread our hours out in the pay period to prevent that. My friend who is also working this job this summer got fourteen hours of over time. She was unable to even claim all of her hours - she's not getting paid for the full time she worked because we were closed down for a week, and it would look suspicious to put down times that no one else would have at all in the entire dining hall staff.   I personally have five hours of overtime that I was told I couldn't claim, and my boss put it down for last Friday and said if anyone asks, we could lie and say I only came in to help unload a delivery truck. In the state of Virginia, which is where I am, overtime (which is when you exceed forty hours in one week) is paid by time and a half, so instead of making $7.25 on those five hours (and my friend on her fourteen that she didn't even get to claim all of), we should have been getting paid $10.88 for each of the hours that we worked over the forty hour limit. By spreading the hours over the pay period, we are only getting paid the minimum for our week of overtime.   I have worked forty hours in the past three days. I'm poor and mostly self supporting, and I used the promise of my paycheck motivate myself to pull through. I need all of the extra money I can get, and frankly, after pulling 12+ hour shifts and only getting six hours of sleep, I feel pretty freaking cheated. My friend is really upset too, because she's in the same boat, and she recently lost her second job.   I have emailed the Virginia Department of Labor, because I went to my boss's supervisor and asked why I couldn't claim the over time that I had worked. He said \"Well, it's just not in the budget.\" I asked him who made the budget, and he said it was campus administration. I ran into my work study employers from the school year, and asked why I was being told I couldn't claim over time. He said the school has the money for it, but doesn't want to pay for it. He also said however that what my boss is doing is extremely wrong, because he's had to give people overtime before. He got chewed out for it, but the student worker was still able to claim their hours and he just made sure not to schedule the student overtime again.   What should I be ready for?? I honestly have no idea what's going to happen from here on out. And I don't want to get in trouble with my boss at work for snitching, or for anyone to get fired, I just want me and my other coworkers to get paid for what we did according to the state's labor laws.",

This may seem inconsequential to some, but for me, this is a big deal..one that has been weighing heavily on my mind the past couple of days..and I do not know where to turn, who to talk to, or if there is any action that can be taken. So...here is my story in short.  I am a first time homeowner. I bought a house in January of 2016 under a construction loan. Although that part does not mean a whole lot to the story, there is a small significance to it. Since my house loan still has not been 'closed' due to us fixing it up, the homeowners insurance cannot be escrowed in yet. Therefore, the first year of homeowners insurance was included in the initial loan amount, and when a year passed, it was time to pay again. This time, it would be out of pocket, because, again. We still have not completed the loan process. Well. We have updated the house significantly. The insurance company told me that I could send in proof of all updates, and that the policy amount would drop significantly. So, time comes to pay the bill, I call the insurance company and they tell me what to send in to update the policy. I send in the documentation. Call back, they don't have everything. Apparently I didnt understand one part. Agent says. No big deal. So I send I'm the proper documentation to the e-mail given to me. I don't hear anything....I send it again. I still don't hear anything. I finally call, and am told that where I sent it was not the proper place. They give me a new place to send it. So I send it...again. At this point I have faxed and emailed. So fast forward to freaking June.... Yes this started in January... And I get a cancelation notice. I call them and explain what is going on, yet once again. They tell me why something wasn't right. I explain to them that it I DID send what they are asking for...once again. They give me a new e-mail to send it to. I send in the info. The insurance agency says, OK, we have this taken care of. You are not canceled and your new policy is $XXX (almost half of what it used to be). I am ecstatic. I get a new e-mail asking for that amount, due by the 28th of June. I pay the full amount on the 12th of June. The money is taken from my account. Fast forward...once again...to yesterday. The bank contacts me to let me know they have received a cancelation notice of my homeowners insurance. I send the confirmation e-mail to my bank, and call the insurance company. After being put on hold numerous times and being on the phone for over an hour, the insurance company tells me that the policy was canceled and the amount I paid was for the coverage from Jan-June! The told me that my policy was NOT canceled and that amount I paid was the new policy amount. There was no mention of the policy only being for the beginning of the year and if my policy was canceled, why was I not offered to reinstate a policy? Oh...that's because they told me it wasn't canceled. Well apparently that is too bad for me. The insurance company gave me a mailing address for a complaint department. They told me I could write a letter and send it in. They would not provide me with a different number, a fax number or e-mail. Just the mailing address. They would not provide me with a refund or a reference number for the call. I also asked for an e-mail to be sent with documentation of contact from the call and proof of attempt of resolution to both me and my bank and they refused.  Now my bank is mad, I'm broke, and uninsured. Do I have any case at all whatsoever? Is there anything I can do? I'm just at a loss at what step to take next. I don't even know if this post will get read at all...but I would be forever grateful for any advice.  TL;DR. Homeowners Insurance agency told me I was covered, took my money, and then canceled my policy. Help.",

The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

Acer also supports and participates in the EICC\u2019s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. \n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: \n\nSupplier risk assessment \n\nAcer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers\u2019 operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.\n\nSupplier audits \n\nAcer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer\u2019s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.\n\nSupply Chain Management Employee Training \n\nAcer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer\u2019s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer\u2019s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code.",

As a global corporation, we support internationally recognized norms for the safety and well being of the employees who are responsible for the manufacture of our products, and we believe that it is incumbent upon ourselves to ensure that the employees\u2019 working environments around the globe meet or exceed these norms. This policy is intended to implement standards which are fair, reflect marketplace conditions, are appropriate to the variety of cultures and peoples which are an important part of our success as a brand, and encourage self-respect amongst our suppliers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 employees with a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nCompliance with Laws and Regulations \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club prefers, as a matter of policy, to do business with Vendors/Suppliers who meet or exceed the standards set by the applicable laws and regulations relating to employee rights and working conditions. Vendors/Suppliers must, at a minimum, comply with all applicable laws and regulations including but not limited to age, hours of work, minimum wage, overtime, provisions for vacation and holidays, pregnancy and menstrual leave, and required retirement benefits. If an industry standard is higher than the legal minimum, Vendors/Suppliers must apply the industry standard in lieu of the inferior law or regulation. \n\nVendors/Suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the exportation and importation of merchandise including country of origin, labeling, customs classifications and valuation and all laws prohibiting counterfeiting trademarks or transshipment of merchandise.\n\nHours of Work/Overtime/Days Off/Holidays\n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club prefers to do business with Vendors/Suppliers who do not require more than 60 hour workweeks on a regular basis. Except in extraordinary circumstances, employees shall not be required to work in excess of 48 hours per week and 12 hours overtime, and shall be entitled to at least one day, consisting of 24 consecutive hours, off in every 7 day period. Full-time employees must have a minimum of two weeks, or level stated in local law, whichever is higher, paid annual leave.\n\nWages/Benefits \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club will seek business partners who share our commitment to the betterment of wage and benefit levels that address the basic needs of workers and their families so far as possible and appropriate in light of national, regional, and industry practices and conditions. Employees must be paid at least the cash equivalent of the minimum legal wage or a wage that is consistent with local industry standards, whichever is greater. Legally permissible deductions for benefits provided by the employer may not effectively reduce the wages and benefits to a level, which prohibits the employee from providing the basic needs for the employee and his or her family. Wages should be paid directly to the employee in cash or check or equivalent; information relating to wages should be available to employees in an understandable form, with accurate and complete records, kept according to generally accepted accounting principles, available for inspection. Wage rates for overtime or any time exceeding 48 hours in a given work week should be at such premium rate as is legally required, but in any event should be higher than the rates for regular hours.\n\nForced Labor \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club will not do business with Vendors/Suppliers who employ forced labor. Vendors/Suppliers may not utilize imprisoned, indentured, bonded or any other form of compulsory labor in the manufacture of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club products, including labor that is imposed as a means of political coercion or as a punishment for political or religious views.\n\nChild Labor \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club will not do business with Vendors/Suppliers that use child labor. No person shall be employed at an age younger than 15 (or 14 where the law of the country of manufacture allows) in apparel factories or 18 in footwear factories, or younger than the age for completing compulsory education in the country of manufacture where such age is higher than 15.\n\nSafety and Health \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club is committed to the health, safety and welfare of the employees manufacturing its products. Vendors/Suppliers must treat all employees with respect and dignity and provide them with a safe and healthy working environment. Factories shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the working environment, and must be free of any hazardous conditions. Vendors/Suppliers who provide residential accommodations for employees must apply similar standards to their residential facilities.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Insurance \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club prefers Vendors/Suppliers who provide appropriate health and life insurance for their employees. Vendors/Suppliers must comply with all appropriate local laws and regulations requiring health insurance, life insurance and worker\u2019s compensation.\n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club is committed to preserving the environment. Vendors/Suppliers must comply with all applicable local environmental laws and regulations and abide by BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club\u2019s own environmental regulations. \n\nEqual Opportunity \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club is absolutely committed to non-discriminatory employment practices. BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club will only do business with Vendors/Suppliers who share BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club\u2019s vision that discrimination is unwelcome in the workplace. Vendors/Suppliers must not discriminate in hiring, salary, benefits, advancement, discipline, termination or retirement on the basis of race, color, nationality, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion, social or ethnic origin, political or other beliefs. Employees should be hired and promoted on the basis of ability, not on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs. \n\nFreedom of Association \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club prefers Vendors/Suppliers who acknowledge each employee\u2019s basic rights to freedom of association. Vendors/Suppliers must ensure that each of their employees has the right to establish and join organizations of the employee\u2019s choosing. Vendors/Suppliers must respect and recognize the rights of all employees to lawfully organize and bargain collectively. Vendors/Suppliers shall not discipline any person in their employment due to that person\u2019s non-violent exercise of such right.\n\nDisciplinary Practices \n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club is firmly committed to the belief that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. Vendors/Suppliers must not inflict or threaten to inflict corporal punishment or any other forms of physical, sexual, psychological or verbal abuse or harassment on any of their employees.\n\nDocumentation and Inspection \n\nVendors/Suppliers must maintain on file such documentation, kept according to generally accepted business practice, as may be needed to illustrate compliance with this Code of Business Conduct and agree to make these documents available for BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club\u2019s review upon request. Vendors/Suppliers shall post this Code of Conduct conspicuously at its factories where it may be seen and understood by all employees in both English and the employees\u2019 native language. Copies shall be supplied to individual employees at their request, and at least once annually, included with the employees\u2019 regular pay.\n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club\u2019s Code of Business Conduct applies to any and all Vendors/Suppliers. Vendors/Suppliers must ensure that any parties supplying them with materials and/or labor in the manufacture of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club products also abide by the provisions of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club\u2019s Code of Business Conduct. Although i\u2019\u2019s Wholesale Club\u2019s Code of Business Conduct, in the event of any willful, non-compliance with these regulations, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club may terminate or refuse to renew supply agreements with a Vendor/Supplier. BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club will apply the standards set forth in this Code of Business Conduct in its selection of new Vendors/Suppliers, as well as its continuation of business with existing Vendors/Suppliers. To assure proper implementation and the on-going compliance with these standards, Vendors/Suppliers must allow BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club full access to its facilities and records from time to time, with or without notice.",

Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbbott\u2019s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery.

        "source": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \n\nHuman trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. \n\nVerification \n\nIn order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. \n\nAuditing \n\nTo ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. \n\nFor the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. \n\nCertification \n\nAll business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that \"Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.\" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. \n\nInternal Accountability \n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. \n\nTraining and Awareness \n\nAll internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. \n\nAll of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking.",

Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.\n\nAdditionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer\u2019s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.\n\nSupplier Declaration \n\nAcer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code.

Due to the huge diversity of conditions at the 177 countries in which we purchased goods and services in the last Fiscal Year (Oct 1st - Sept 30), this maxim of Siemens\u2018 business policy was considered in the principles of the \u201cCode of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers\u201d. It is based on \u2013 among others \u2013 the UN Global Compact and the principles of the International Labor Organization but also reflects the Siemens \u201cBusiness Conduct Guidelines\u201d, which establishes fundamental principles of sustainability and apply to the entire company.\n\nSiemens operates not only in accordance with clear Business Conduct Guidelines, which are mandatory worldwide, but also with directives to concentrate business with only the best suppliers who agree to and comply with our standards in the supply chain. In the long term we cooperate only with suppliers who place as much value on Sustainability as we do and who adhere to the principles of Global Compact with respect to human rights and work relationships.\n\nIn order to continuously monitor and improve the performance of our suppliers we utilize a consistent Supplier Management System. At the foundation of this system is our process by which we obtain supplier contractual commitment to responsibilities towards their stakeholders and the environment through the Siemens Supplier Code of Conduct. The code addresses the following concepts:\n\n\t\tCompliance with laws. \n\n\t\tProhibition of Corruption and Bribery \n\n\t\tRespect for Basic Human Rights of Employees (which includes to refuse to employ or make \u2028anyone work against his or her will) \n\n\t\tProhibition of Child Labor \n\n\t\tHealth and Safety of Employees \n\n\t\tEnvironmental Protection \n\n\t\tPromotion of the above principles in the supply chain of the supplier \u2028The full Supplier Code of Conduct document and detailed description of the key provisions can be found under the following link: https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx) \u2028Once a supplier becomes part of the Siemens supply chain, it then becomes subject to the compliance verification activities established as part of the Supplier Management System. The system uses a combination of four approaches to accomplish the compliance verification process. These approaches are: Sustainability Self Assessments, Risk Evaluations performed by the responsible Siemens Buyer, Sustainability Audits performed by third parties and Siemens Quality audits. These audits include determining if the supplier adheres to the Code of Conduct. Further information on our systematic approach can be found at www.siemens.com/sr/detection-modules \u2028Siemens Management System considers the assessment and audit findings and then employs supplier development actions which establish improvement measures to be taken by suppliers to mitigate or correct issues raised in audit findings. If a supplier fails to execute the agreed upon measures, Siemens may terminate any existing business with the supplier. This termination right is established in Siemens supplier contracts and purchase terms and conditions. \n\n \n\nThe number of 3rd party audits and number of findings are published in the Siemens Sustainability Report, and can be accessed through the following links: (www.siemens.com/scm/sustainability; or specific suppliers chapter under : http://www.siemens.com/sustainability/pool/en/current-reporting/sr2010_suppliers.pdf).\n\nEnergy Efficiency Program for Suppliers\n\nIn order to orient our entire supply chain in an ecological manner, we work closely with our suppliers to identify and implement measures for the efficient use of resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we developed our Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers (EEP4Suppliers) which provides access to know-how and experience from our own Environmental Program and Environmental Portfolio.\n\nIn fiscal 2010, we successfully piloted EEP4Suppliers at 17 production facilities operated by major suppliers. Plans call for the first 1,000 suppliers to be integrated in the EEP4Suppliers program by the end of fiscal 2012.\n\nOrganization Awareness.\n\nAll Procurement professionals within the Siemens Supply Chain organization are trained on the \u201cOne Supplier Certification\u201d process and related Code of Conduct requirements so that the principles can be effectively explained to suppliers. Additionally Siemens conducts sustainability workshops with our suppliers in higher-risk-countries. The workshops include presentations by Environment, Health and Safety Officers who lead break-out sessions that address human right topics such as worker safety.\n\nWeb Based Trainings in Sustainability are available for suppliers as well as internal Siemens personnel and can be accessed through the following link. https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx\n\n* This information explains Siemens activities in support of and commitment to the principles found in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from supply chains.",

This means not purchasing products known to be manufactured by the use of: forced labor, abusive labor practices, child labor, or other practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured.\u201d\n\nGiven the largely closeout nature of much of the Company\u2019s merchandise, its price points, and the ever-changing nature and composition of the merchandise it purchases and offers for sale, it is not feasible for the Company to comprehensively verify product supply chains or audit supplier compliance, but the Company does send its own employees to a number of the overseas factories from which it buys product for tours and announced inspections. Further, the Company also requires its direct suppliers to certify, in writing, that their products sold to the Company are not the result of any proscribed practices and that the supplier complies with the laws of all countries in which the supplier does business. In fact, the Company\u2019s vendor contracts contain the following requirement:\n\n\u201cIt is Purchaser\u2019s policy not to purchase products manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices, such as forced labor, abusive labor practices, or child labor. Neither will Purchaser buy merchandise made as a result of any practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured. By signing or shipping under 99 Cents\u2019 PO, Seller attests to the fact that after a diligent inquiry, Seller has ascertained that no product that is the subject of this Purchase Order has been manufactured using any such forced, involuntary, exploitive, or unfair labor practices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Any supplier found to have falsely certified its compliance with the Company\u2019s policy will no longer be used by the Company as one of its vendors. The Company\u2019s buyers are also expected to comply with this policy, although it is not feasible for the Company to maintain a formal accountability program or to provide regular training on these topics to employees and managers operating in these areas, for the same reasons explained above.",
